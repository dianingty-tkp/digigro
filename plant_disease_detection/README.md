# DIGIGRO - Plant Disease Detection

The objective of this project is to create an app prototype that help new farmers start their urban farming journey. Plant disease detection is one of the features that is called `CheckIt`. This feature helps user to undertand the health condition of their crops and know hoe to manage it.

This code include training code and prediction code. To run this code, clone this repo then download the data from kaggle in this link [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset).

Trined model could be downloaded from GDrive in this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17vprToHWJPAoNCS3k_yBsejQ2TznFMYh/view?usp=sharing). Unzip this model in this directory and it can be used to predict any leaf images. Example sxript to do the prediction can be found in `prediction_prototype.ipynb`.

The performance of this model is:
- Test accuracy: 0.8151
- Test categorical accuracy: 0.8151
